1. Traffic Density vs. Average Speed:
* Inverse Relationship: As traffic density increases, the average vehicle speed decreases. This indicates that higher traffic volumes lead to slower vehicle speeds, which is expected.
* Congestion Points: Identify congestion points where traffic density is extremely high, causing significant reductions in average speed. These points can be targeted for traffic management interventions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11887794-780d-45df-90f0-d9a8436937e6)

2. Traffic Density by Signal Status:
* Highest Density at Red Signals: The bar chart shows that traffic density is highest when the signal is red. This suggests that vehicles accumulate when the signal is red, leading to higher congestion.
* Moderate Density at Green Signals: Traffic density is moderate when the signal is green, indicating that vehicles move through the intersection more smoothly but still experience some delays.
* Lowest Density at Yellow Signals: Traffic density is lowest when the signal is yellow, possibly because vehicles are either preparing to stop or accelerate, resulting in less accumulation.
